## 🌍 *Introduction*

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing global transportation by offering a cleaner, more efficient alternative to traditional fuel-based vehicles.  
As the world moves toward sustainability, understanding what drives the *price of an electric vehicle* is vital.  

This project focuses on using *Machine Learning* to predict the *price of an EV* based on its technical specifications — such as range, efficiency, acceleration, and top speed.  
The insights gained can assist both manufacturers and customers in making better, data-driven decisions.

## 🧠 *Problem Statement*

Develop a *machine learning model* that predicts the *price of electric vehicles* using multiple performance and design parameters.  

### 🎯 *Objectives*
1. Collect and preprocess an EV dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Perform *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* and feature engineering.  
3. Train regression models to predict prices accurately.  
4. Compare model performance using error metrics.  
5. Present results through visualizations and documentation.
